In this lab exercise, we'll deploy the rest of the sample application efficiently using the power of Kustomize. The following kustomization file shows how you can reference other kustomizations and deploy multiple components together:

```file
manifests/base-application/kustomization.yaml
```

:::tip
Notice that the catalog API is in this kustomization, didn't we already deploy it?

Because Kubernetes uses a declarative mechanism we can apply the manifests for the catalog API again and expect that because all of the resources are already created Kubernetes will take no action.
:::

Apply this kustomization to our cluster to deploy the rest of the components:

```bash wait=10
$ kubectl apply -k ~/environment/eks-workshop/base-application
```

After this is complete we can use `kubectl wait` to make sure all the components have started before we proceed:

```bash timeout=200
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --timeout=180s pods \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/created-by=eks-workshop -A
```

We'll now have a Namespace for each of our application components:

```bash
$ kubectl get namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/created-by=eks-workshop
NAME       STATUS   AGE
assets     Active   62s
carts      Active   62s
catalog    Active   7m17s
checkout   Active   62s
orders     Active   62s
other      Active   62s
rabbitmq   Active   62s
ui         Active   62s
```

We can also see all of the Deployments created for the components:

```bash
$ kubectl get deployment -l app.kubernetes.io/created-by=eks-workshop -A
NAMESPACE   NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
assets      assets           1/1     1            1           90s
carts       carts            1/1     1            1           90s
carts       carts-dynamodb   1/1     1            1           90s
catalog     catalog          1/1     1            1           7m46s
checkout    checkout         1/1     1            1           90s
checkout    checkout-redis   1/1     1            1           90s
orders      orders           1/1     1            1           90s
orders      orders-mysql     1/1     1            1           90s
ui          ui               1/1     1            1           90s
```

The sample application is now deployed and ready to provide a foundation for us to use in the rest of the labs in this workshop!
