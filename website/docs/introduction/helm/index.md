Prepare your environment for this section:

Although we will primarily be interacting with kustomize in this workshop, there will be situations where Helm will be used to install certain packages in the EKS cluster. In this lab we give a brief introduction to Helm, and we'll demonstrate how to use it to install a pre-packaged application.

:::info

This lab doesn't not cover the authoring of Helm charts for your own workloads. For more information on this topic see this [guide](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/).

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes applications. It uses a packaging format called charts, which contain all the necessary Kubernetes resource definitions to run an application. Helm simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters.

## Helm CLI

The `helm` CLI tool is typically used in conjunction with a Kubernetes cluster to manage the deployment and lifecycle of applications. It provides a consistent and repeatable way to package, install, and manage applications on Kubernetes, making it easier to automate and standardize application deployments across different environments.

The CLI is already installed in our IDE:

```bash
$ helm version
```

## Helm repositories

A Helm repository is a centralized location where Helm charts are stored and managed, and allow users to easily discover, share, and install charts. They facilitate easy access to a wide range of pre-packaged applications and services for deployment on Kubernetes clusters.

The [Bitnami](https://github.com/bitnami/charts) Helm repository is a collection of Helm charts for deploying popular applications and tools on Kubernetes. Let's add the `bitnami` repository to our Helm CLI:

```bash
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm repo update
```

Now we can search the repository for charts, for example the `postgresql` chart:

```bash
$ helm search repo postgresql
NAME                    CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
bitnami/postgresql      X.X.X           X.X.X           PostgreSQL (Postgres) is an open source object-...
[...]
```

## Installing a Helm chart

Let's install an NGINX server in our EKS cluster using the Helm chart we found above. When you install a chart using the Helm package manager, it creates a new **release** for that chart. Each release is tracked by Helm and can be upgraded, rolled back, or uninstalled independently from other releases.

```bash
$ echo $NGINX_CHART_VERSION
$ helm install nginx bitnami/nginx \
  --version $NGINX_CHART_VERSION \
  --namespace nginx --create-namespace --wait
```

We can break this command down as follows:

- Use the `install` sub-command to instruct Helm to install a chart
- Name the release `nginx`
- Use the chart `bitnami/nginx` with the version $NGINX_CHART_VERSION
- Install the chart in the `nginx` namespace and create that namespace first
- Wait for pods in the release to get to a ready state

Once the chart has installed we can list the releases in our EKS cluster:

```bash
$ helm list -A
NAME 	 NAMESPACE  REVISION  UPDATED                                  STATUS    CHART         APP VERSION
nginx	 nginx      1         2024-06-11 03:58:39.862100855 +0000 UTC  deployed  nginx-X.X.X   X.X.X
```

We can also see NGINX running in the namespace we specified:

```bash
$ kubectl get pod -n nginx
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-55fbd7f494-zplwx   1/1     Running   0          119s
```

## Configuring chart options

In the example above we installed the NGINX chart in its default configuration. Sometimes you'll need to provide configuration **values** to charts during installation to modify the way the component behaves.

There are two common ways to provide values to charts during installation:

1. Create YAML files and pass them to Helm using the `-f` or `--values` flag
1. Pass values using the `--set` flag followed by `key=value` pairs

Let's combine these methods to update our NGINX release. We'll use this `values.yaml` file:

```file
manifests/modules/introduction/helm/values.yaml
```

This adds several custom Kubernetes labels to the NGINX pods, as well as setting some resource requests.

We'll also add additional replicas using the `--set` flag:

```bash
$ helm upgrade --install nginx bitnami/nginx \
  --version $NGINX_CHART_VERSION \
  --namespace nginx --create-namespace --wait \
  --set replicaCount=3 \
  --values ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/introduction/helm/values.yaml
```

List the releases:

```bash
$ helm list -A
NAME 	 NAMESPACE  REVISION  UPDATED                                  STATUS    CHART         APP VERSION
nginx	 nginx      2         2024-06-11 04:13:53.862100855 +0000 UTC  deployed  nginx-X.X.X   X.X.X
```

You'll notice that the **revision** column has updated to **2** as Helm has applied our updated configuration as a distinct revision. This would allow us to rollback to our previous configuration if necessary.

You can view the revision history of a given release like this:

```bash
$ helm history nginx -n nginx
REVISION  UPDATED                   STATUS      CHART        APP VERSION  DESCRIPTION
1         Tue Jun 11 03:58:39 2024  superseded  nginx-X.X.X  X.X.X       Install complete
2         Tue Jun 11 04:13:53 2024  deployed    nginx-X.X.X  X.X.X       Upgrade complete
```

To check that our changes have taken effect list the pods in the `nginx` namespace:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n nginx
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-55fbd7f494-4hz9b   1/1     Running   0          30s
nginx-55fbd7f494-gkr2j   1/1     Running   0          30s
nginx-55fbd7f494-zplwx   1/1     Running   0          5m
```

You can see we now have 3 replicas of the NGINX pod running.

## Removing releases

We can similarly uninstall a release using the CLI:

```bash
$ helm uninstall nginx --namespace nginx --wait
```

This will delete all the resources created by the chart for that release from our EKS cluster.

Now that you understand how Helm works, proceed to the [Fundamentals module](/docs/fundamentals).
