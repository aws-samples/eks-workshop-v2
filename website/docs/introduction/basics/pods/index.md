**Pods** are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. A Pod represents one or more containers that share storage, network, and configuration settings for how they should run together.

Pods provide:
- **Container grouping:** Usually, a pod runs a single container, but it can include multiple tightly coupled containers that need to share data or communicate over localhost.
- **Shared networking:** All containers in a pod share the same IP address
- **Shared storage:** Containers can share volumes within the pod
- **Lifecycle management:** Containers in a pod live and die together
- **Ephemeral nature:** Pods can be created, destroyed, and recreated

In this lab, you'll learn about pods by creating a simple example pod and exploring its properties.

### Creating a Pod

Let's create a simple pod to understand how they work. The manifest defines a simple pod running the retail store UI container.

::yaml{file="manifests/modules/introduction/basics/pods/ui-pod.yaml" paths="kind,metadata.name,metadata.namespace,spec.containers,spec.containers.0.name,spec.containers.0.image,spec.containers.0.ports,spec.containers.0.env,spec.containers.0.resources" title="ui-pod.yaml"}

1. `kind: Pod`: Tells Kubernetes what type of resource to create
2. `metadata.name`: Unique identifier for this pod within the namespace
3. `metadata.namespace`: Which namespace the pod belongs to (ui namespace)
4. `spec.containers`: Array defining what containers run in the pod
5. `spec.containers.0.name`: Name of the first container (ui)
6. `spec.containers.0.image`: Container image from ECR Public registry
7. `spec.containers.0.ports`: Network ports the container exposes
8. `spec.containers.0.env`: Environment variables for the container
9. `spec.containers.0.resources`: CPU and memory allocation settings

Apply the pod configuration:
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/introduction/basics/pods/ui-pod.yaml
```

Kubernetes will create the pod in the `ui` namespace and start pulling the container image.

Wait for the pod to become ready:
```bash
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --timeout=60s -n ui pod/ui-pod
```

### Exploring Pod

Now let's examine the pod we just created:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n ui
NAME     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ui-pod   1/1     Running   0          30s
```

Get detailed information about the pod:
```bash
$ kubectl describe pod -n ui ui-pod

 :: Spring Boot ::                (v3.4.4)

2025-10-05T19:28:06.600Z  INFO 1 --- [           main] c.a.s.u.UiApplication                    : Starting UiApplication v0.0.1-SNAPSHOT using Java 21.0.7 with PID 1 (/app/app.jar started by appuser in /app)
2025-10-05T19:28:06.658Z  INFO 1 --- [           main] c.a.s.u.UiApplication                    : The following 1 profile is active: "prod"
2025-10-05T19:28:10.268Z  INFO 1 --- [           main] i.o.i.s.a.OpenTelemetryAutoConfiguration : OpenTelemetry Spring Boot starter has been disabled

2025-10-05T19:28:14.075Z  INFO 1 --- [           main] c.a.s.u.UiApplication                    : Started UiApplication in 8.505 seconds (process running for 10.444)
```

> You’ll see the UI container starting up. 

Execute a command inside the pod:
```bash hook=ready
$ kubectl exec -n ui ui-pod -- curl -s localhost:8080/actuator/health
{"status":"UP","groups":["liveness","readiness"]}
```
This should return the status of the application.

### Accessing Pod

You can access the pod from your local machine using port forwarding:
```bash test=false
$ kubectl port-forward -n ui ui-pod 8080:8080
```

:::info
Port forwarding temporarily connects your local port to a port inside the pod, allowing you to access the application directly from your laptop.
:::

In the Workshop IDE, a popup appears to view all forwarded ports. Click to open applicaiton URL in the browser.

Alternatively, open another terminal and test:
```bash test=false
$ curl localhost:8080
```

In the browser, You'll see the Retail store application landing page.

Press `CTRL+C` to break `port-forward` session.

### Pod Lifecycle

Pods have well-defined lifecycle phases that reflect their current state in the cluster.
- **Pending** - Pod is being scheduled and containers are starting
- **Running** - At least one container is running
- **Succeeded** - All containers have completed successfully
- **Failed** - At least one container has failed
- **Unknown** - Pod state cannot be determined

Kubernetes controllers continuously monitor pod states and take action (like restarting failed containers or recreating pods) to maintain desired application health.

## Key Points to Remember

* Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
* Usually contain one container, but can contain multiple
* Share network and storage within the pod
* Pods are ephemeral - they come and go
* Typically managed by higher-level controllers like Deployments

:::info
In real-world scenarios, you rarely create pods directly — instead, you use higher-level resources like Deployments, ReplicaSets, or Jobs to manage them.
