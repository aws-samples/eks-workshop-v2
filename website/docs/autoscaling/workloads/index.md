Now that we've established the concepts of autoscaling compute, we can take a comprehensive look at the different ways to scale resources and manage workloads in a cluster. We'll cover two main mechanisms for autoscaling:

- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Cluster Proportional Autoscaler (CPA)

In this chapter, we'll explore the process of configuring and using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Proportional Autoscaler (CPA) to manage workloads in a cluster.
