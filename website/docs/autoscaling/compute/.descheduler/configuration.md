Before we begin let's reset our environment:

```bash timeout=300 wait=30
$ prepare-environment
```

The descheduler component can be installed as a `Job`, `CronJob`, `Deployment` in a cluster. In this workshop, descheduler is installed as a `Deployment` object with 1 minute interval.

A policy has been pre-configured in the environment, which you can see:

```bash
$ kubectl describe cm descheduler -n kube-system
```
