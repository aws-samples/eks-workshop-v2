For Kubernetes cluster components that run in pods, these write to files inside the `/var/log` directory, bypassing the default logging mechanism. We can implement pod-level logging by deploying a node-level logging agent as a DaemonSet on each node, such as Fluent Bit.

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) is a lightweight log processor and forwarder that allows you to collect data and logs from different sources, enrich them with filters and send them to multiple destinations like CloudWatch, Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon OpenSearch Service.

AWS provides a Fluent Bit image with plugins for both CloudWatch Logs and Kinesis Data Firehose. The [AWS for Fluent Bit](https://github.com/aws/aws-for-fluent-bit) image is available on the [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/aws-observability/aws-for-fluent-bit).

Fluent Bit can be used to ship logs to various destinations. However, in this lab, we will see how it is leveraged to ship the container logs to CloudWatch.

In the following section, you will see how to validate Fluent Bit agent is already running as a DaemonSet to send the containers / Pods logs to CloudWatch Logs. Read more about how to [deploy Fluent Bit to send logs from containers to CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-setup-logs-FluentBit.html#Container-Insights-FluentBit-troubleshoot).

First, we can validate the resources created for Fluent Bit by entering the following command. Each node should have one Pod:

```bash hook=get-all
$ kubectl get all -n kube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=aws-for-fluent-bit
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/aws-for-fluent-bit-jg4jr   1/1     Running   0          94s
pod/aws-for-fluent-bit-lvp9f   1/1     Running   0          95s
pod/aws-for-fluent-bit-q959s   1/1     Running   0          94s

NAME                         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/aws-for-fluent-bit   ClusterIP   172.16.41.165   <none>        2020/TCP   96s

NAME                                DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
daemonset.apps/aws-for-fluent-bit   3         3         3       3            3           <none>          96s
```

The ConfigMap for aws-for-fluent-bit is configured to stream the contents of files in the directory `/var/log/containers/*.log` from each node to the CloudWatch log group `/eks-workshop/worker-fluentbit-logs`:

```bash hook=desc-cm
$ kubectl describe configmap -n kube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=aws-for-fluent-bit
Name:         aws-for-fluent-bit
Namespace:    kube-system

              app.kubernetes.io/version=2.31.12.20231011

Use the `kubectl logs` command to check the Fluent Bit Pod logs, where you will observe new CloudWatch Log groups and streams are created for the services.

```bash hook=pods-log
$ kubectl logs daemonset.apps/aws-for-fluent-bit -n kube-system
