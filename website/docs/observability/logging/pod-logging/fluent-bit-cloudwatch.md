In this lab exercise, we'll see how to check the Kubernetes pod logs forwarded by the Fluent Bit agent deployed on each node to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The deployed application components write logs to `stdout`, which are saved in the `/var/log/containers/*.log` path on each node.

First, lets recycle the pods for the `ui` component to make sure fresh logs are written since we enabled Fluent Bit:

```bash
$ kubectl delete pod -n ui --all
$ kubectl rollout status deployment/ui \
  -n ui --timeout 30s
deployment "ui" successfully rolled out
```

Now we can check that our `ui` component is creating logs by directly using `kubectl logs`:

```bash
$ kubectl logs -n ui deployment/ui

Open the CloudWatch Logs console to check these logs are appearing:

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?#logsV2:log-groups

Filter for **fluentbit-cloudwatch** to find the log groups created by Fluent Bit:

![CloudWatch Log Group](./assets/log-group.png)

Select `/aws/eks/fluentbit-cloudwatch/workload/ui` to view the log streams, each one corresponds to an individual pod:

You can expand one of the log entries to see the full JSON payload:
