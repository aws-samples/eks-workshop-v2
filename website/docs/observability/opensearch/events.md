This section demonstrates how we can export Kubernetes events to OpenSearch and use OpenSearch to improve observability of the EKS cluster. We'll deploy the Kubernetes [events exporter](https://github.com/resmoio/kubernetes-event-exporter) to forward events to OpenSearch, generate additional Kubernetes events by creating test workloads, explore the OpenSearch Kubernetes events dashboard, identify issues and optionally explore events within the Kubernetes cluster

[Kubernetes Events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/) provide a rich source of information that can be used to monitor applications and cluster state, respond to failures and perform diagnostics. Events generally denote some state change. Examples include pod creation, adding replicas and scheduling resources. Each event includes a ```type``` field which is set to Normal or Warning to indicate success of failure.

You've already worked with Kubernetes events if you have ever run ``kubectl describe`` on a resource. As shown below the last section of output from `kubectl describe` displays the Kubernetes events related to the resource.

```shell
kubectl describe pod nginx
...
Events:
  Type    Reason     Age   From               Message
  ----    ------     ----  ----               -------
  Normal  Scheduled  5s    default-scheduler  Successfully assigned default/nginx to ip-10-42-179-183.us-west-2.compute.internal
  Normal  Pulling    4s    kubelet            Pulling image "nginx"
  Normal  Pulled     4s    kubelet            Successfully pulled image "nginx" in 627.545722ms (627.553403ms including waiting)
  Normal  Created    4s    kubelet            Created container nginx
  Normal  Started    3s    kubelet            Started container nginx
```

Kubernetes events are continuously generated but retained within the cluster for only one hour.  This retention period is consistent with the Kubernetes upstream default event time-to-live (TTL) of 60 minutes. OpenSearch provides a durable store that simplifies collection, analysis and visualization of these events.

The following diagram provides an overview of the setup for this section. ```kubernetes-events-exporter``` will be deployed in the ```opensearch-exporter``` namespace to forward events to the OpenSearch domain. Events are stored in the ```eks-kubernetes-events``` index in OpenSearch.  An OpenSearch dashboard that we loaded earlier is used to visualize the events.

![Kubernetes events to OpenSearch](./assets/eks-events-overview.svg)

Deploy Kubernetes events exporter and configure it to send events to our OpenSearch domain. The base configuration is available [here](https://github.com/VAR::MANIFESTS_OWNER/VAR::MANIFESTS_REPOSITORY/tree/VAR::MANIFESTS_REF/manifests/modules/observability/opensearch/config/events-exporter-values.yaml). The OpenSearch credentials we retrieved earlier are being used to configure the exporter. The second command verifies that the Kubernetes events pod is running.

```bash timeout=120 wait=30
$ helm install events-to-opensearch \
    oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/kubernetes-event-exporter \
    --namespace opensearch-exporter --create-namespace \
    -f ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/observability/opensearch/config/events-exporter-values.yaml \
    --set="config.receivers[0].opensearch.username"="$OPENSEARCH_USER" \
    --set="config.receivers[0].opensearch.password"="$OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD" \
    --set="config.receivers[0].opensearch.hosts[0]"="https://$OPENSEARCH_HOST" \
    --wait
...
NAME: events-to-opensearch
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Oct 20 01:04:56 2023
NAMESPACE: opensearch-exporter
...
 
$ kubectl get pods -n opensearch-exporter
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
events-to-opensearch-kubernetes-event-exporter-67fc698978-2f9wc   1/1     Running   0             10s
```

Now we'll generate additional Kubernetes events by launching three deployments labelled `scenario-a, scenario-b and scenario-c` within the `test` namespace to demonstrate `Normal` and `Warning` events. Each deployment intentionally includes an error.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -k ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/observability/opensearch/scenarios/events/base
namespace/test created
secret/some-secret created
deployment.apps/scenario-a created
deployment.apps/scenario-b created
deployment.apps/scenario-c created
```

:::tip

The Kubernetes events exporter we launched in the previous step sends events from the last hour and any new ones to OpenSearch. Therefore, the exact list of events we see when we run the following commands and inspect the OpenSearch dashboard will vary depending on the EKS cluster activity within the last hour.

:::

Explore the OpenSearch Kubernetes events dashboard by returning to the OpenSearch dashboard that we used in the previous page. Access the `EKS Workshop - Kubernetes Events Dashboard` from the dashboard landing page we saw earlier or use the command below to obtain its coordinates:

```bash
$ printf "\nKubernetes Events dashboard: https://%s/_dashboards/app/dashboards#/view/06cca640-6a05-11ee-bdf2-9d2ccb0785e7 \
        \nUserName: %q \nPassword: %q \n\n" \
        "$OPENSEARCH_HOST" "$OPENSEARCH_USER" "$OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD"
 
Kubernetes Events dashboard: <OpenSearch Dashboard URL>       
Username: <user name>       
Password: <password>
```

The live dashboard should look similar to the image below but the numbers and messages will vary depending on cluster activity. An explanation of the dashboards sections and fields follows.

1. [Header] Shows date / time  range.  We can customize the time range that we are exploring with this dashboard (Last 30 minutes in this example)
2. [Top section] Date histogram of events (split between Normal and Warning events)
3. [Middle section] Kubernetes events shows the total number of events (Normal and Warning)
4. [Middle section] Warning events seen during the selected time interval.
5. [Middle section] Warnings broken out by namespace. All the warnings are in the `test` namespace in this example
6. [Bottom section] Detailed events and messages with most recent event first

![Kubernetes Events dashboard](./assets/events-dashboard.png)

The next image focuses on the bottom section with event details including:

1. Last timestamp for the event
1. Event type (normal or warning).  Notice that hovering our mouse over a field enables us to filter by that value (e.g. filter for Warning events)
1. Name of Kubernetes resource (along with the object type and namespace)
1. Human readable message

![Kubernetes Events debugging](./assets/events-debug.png)

We can drill down into the full event details as shown in the following image:

1. Clicking on the '>' next to each event opens up a new section
1. The full event document can be viewed as a table or in JSON format

An explanation of data fields within Kubernetes events can be found on [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1) or by running `kubectl explain events`.

![Kubernetes Events detail](./assets/events-detail.png)

We can use the Kubernetes events dashboard to identify why the three deployments (```scenario-a, scenario-b and scenario-c```) are experiencing issues. All the pods we deployed earlier are in the ```test``` namespace.

**scenario-a:** From the dashboard we can see that ```scenario-a``` has a reason of `FailedMount` and the message `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "secret-volume" : secret "misspelt-secret-name" not found`.  The pod is attempting to mount a secret that does not exist.

![Answer for scenario-a](./assets/scenario-a.png)

**scenario-b:**  ```scenario-b``` has failed with a message `Failed to pull image "wrong-image": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to pull and unpack image "docker.io/library/wrong-image:latest": failed to resolve reference "docker.io/library/wrong-image:latest": pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization: server message: insufficient_scope: authorization failed.` The pod is not getting created because it references a non-existent image.

![Answer for scenario-b](./assets/scenario-b.png)

**scenario-c:** The dashboard shows a reason of `FailedScheduling` and the message `0/3 nodes are available: 3 Insufficient cpu. preemption: 0/3 nodes are available: 3 No preemption victims found for incoming pod.` This deployment is requesting CPU that exceeds what any of the current cluster nodes can provide. (We do not have any of the cluster autoscaling capabilities enabled within this module of EKS workshop.)

![Answer for scenario-c](./assets/scenario-c.png)

Fix the issues and revisit OpenSearch dashboard to see changes

```bash
$ kubectl apply -k ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/observability/opensearch/scenarios/events/fix
namespace/test unchanged
secret/some-secret unchanged
deployment.apps/scenario-a configured
deployment.apps/scenario-b configured
deployment.apps/scenario-c configured
```

Go back to the OpenSearch dashboard and notice that the earlier issues have been resolved. The updated deployment launches new pods that are successful and the pods created earlier (with errors) are deleted.

:::tip
As issues are fixed, a new set of Normal Kubernetes events are generated. The earlier events (Normal or Warning) remain as part of the history. Therefore the number of Normal and Warning events always *increases*.
:::

We can optionally explore Kubernetes events from within the EKS cluster. The events we were exploring from within the OpenSearch dashboard mirror the information that is available within the cluster.

Retrieve the five most recent events in the cluster.

```bash
$ kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' -A | head -5
NAMESPACE             LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON              OBJECT                                                                 MESSAGE

```

See the most recent event (across all namespaces) in JSON format. Notice that the output is very similar to the details found within the OpenSearch index. (The Opensearch document has additional fields to facilitate indexing within OpenSearch).

```bash
$ kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' -o json -A | jq '.items[-1]'
