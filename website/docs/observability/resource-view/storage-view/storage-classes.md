A [StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) provides a way for administrators to describe the "classes" of storage that are available to a cluster. Different classes might map to quality-of-service levels, or to backup policies, or to arbitrary policies determined by cluster administrators.
