[ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) is a Kubernetes resource object to save configuration data in key-value format. The ConfigMaps are useful to store environment variables, command-line arguments, application config that can be accessed by the applications deployed in the pods. ConfigMaps can also be stored as configuration files in a volume. These help the configuration data to be separated from the application code.

Click on the ConfigMap drill down and you can see all the configs for the cluster.

If you click on the ConfigMap <i>checkout</i> you can see the properties associated with it, in this case, the key REDIS_URL with the value of the redis endpoint. As you can see, the value is not encrypted and ConfigMaps should not be used to store any confidential key-value pairs.
