[Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) is a Kubernetes resource object for storing sensitive pieces of data such as username, passwords, tokens, and other credentials. Secrets are helpful to organize and distribute sensitive information across the pods in a cluster. Secrets can be used in a variety of ways, such as being mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables to be used by a container in a Pod.

Click on the Secrets drill down and you can see all the secrets for the cluster.
