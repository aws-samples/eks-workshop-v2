In the 1st lab, we'll collect the metrics, logs, and traces from the application using [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://aws-otel.github.io/), store the metrics in [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus), logs in [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki), traces in [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo) and visualize using [Amazon Managed Grafana](https://aws.amazon.com/grafana).

In the 2nd lab, we'll take a look at how to use [Kubecost](https://www.kubecost.com) to collect and store the data in [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus) and then walkthrough some of its features that provide the cost visibility and insights for the workloads running inside the EKS cluster.
