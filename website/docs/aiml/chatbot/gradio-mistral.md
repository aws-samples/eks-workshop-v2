After all the resources have been configured within the Ray Serve Cluster, it's now time to directly access the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 chatbot. The web interface is powered by the Gradio UI.

You can learn more about Load Balancers in the [Load Balancer module](../../fundamentals/exposing/loadbalancer/index.md) provided in this workshop.

### Deploying Gradio Web User Interface

Once the AWS Load Balancer Controller has been installed, we can deploy the Gradio UI components.

```file
manifests/modules/aiml/chatbot/gradio-mistral/gradio-ui.yaml
```

The components consist of a `Deployment`, `Service`, and `ConfigMap` to launch the application. In particular, the `Service` component is named gradio-service and is deployed as a `LoadBalancer`.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -k ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/aiml/chatbot/gradio-mistral
namespace/gradio-mistral-trn1 created
configmap/gradio-app-script created
service/gradio-service created
deployment.apps/gradio-deployment created
```

To check the status of each component, run the following commands:

```bash
$ kubectl get deployments -n gradio-mistral-trn1
NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
gradio-deployment   1/1     1            1           95s
```

```bash
$ kubectl get configmaps -n gradio-mistral-trn1
NAME                DATA   AGE
gradio-app-script   1      110s
kube-root-ca.crt    1      111s
```

### Accessing the Chatbot Website

Once the load balancer has finished deploying, use the external IP address to directly access the website:

```bash wait=10
$ kubectl get services -n gradio-mistral-trn1
NAME             TYPE          ClUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP                                                                      PORT(S)         AGE
gradio-service   LoadBalancer  172.20.84.26  k8s-gradioll-gradiose-a6d0b586ce-06885d584b38b400.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com    80:30802/TCP    8m42s
```

To wait until the Network Load Balancer has finished provisioning, run the following command:

```bash wait=300 timeout=1200
$ curl --head -X GET --retry 30 --retry-all-errors --retry-delay 15 --connect-timeout 60 --max-time 90 \
-k $(kubectl get service -n gradio-mistral-trn1 gradio-service -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].hostname}{'\n'}")
```

Now that our application is exposed to the outside world, let's access it by pasting the URL in your web browser. You will see the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 chatbot and will be able to interact with it by asking questions.

<Browser url="http://k8s-gradioll-gradiose-a6d0b586ce-06885d584b38b400.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com">
<img src={require('@site/static/img/sample-app-screens/gardio_mistral_SS.png').default}/>
</Browser>

This concludes the current lab on deploying the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 Chatbot Model within an EKS Cluster via Karpenter.
