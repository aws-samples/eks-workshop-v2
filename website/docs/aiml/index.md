As organizations increasingly adopt AI and ML technologies, the need for scalable, efficient infrastructure becomes crucial. Amazon EKS provides a powerful platform for deploying and managing ML workloads, offering the flexibility of Kubernetes combined with seamless integration of specialized AWS ML accelerators and services. In this lab, you'll learn how to leverage EKS for training and deploying ML models, optimize GPU resource utilization, implement best practices for orchestrating ML pipelines at scale, and using Amazon Q CLI to perform EKS cluster operations using natural language commands. Whether you're working with real-time inference, distributed training, or generative AI workloads, EKS provides the robust foundation needed for production-grade ML operations.
