AI on EKS is an open source initiative from AWS designed to help customers deploy, scale, and optimize artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) workloads on Amazon EKS. AI on EKS provides deployment-ready blueprints facilitating training, fine-tuning, and inference of multiple large language models (LLMs), infrastructure as code (IaC) templates to enable reference architectures as well as customizable platforms, benchmarks comparing different training and deployment strategies, and best practices for tasks such as model training, inference, fine-tuning, multi-model serving, and more.
