The Kubernetes project is constantly updated with new features, design updates, and bug fixes. New minor versions are released on average every four months and are supported for about twelve months after their release. So, one of the key considerations for Amazon EKS users is to plan and execute these version updates in a timely manner.

Refer the Amazon EKS Upgrades Workshop below for step-by-step guidance and best practices in planning and upgrading EKS Clusters. It includes a series of labs describing various stages of an upgrade process, starting from preparation, choosing an upgrade plan, executing the upgrade, while maintaining availability during the process.
