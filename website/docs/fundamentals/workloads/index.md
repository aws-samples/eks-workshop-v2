Now that we've established the concepts of autoscaling compute, we can take a comprehensive look at the different ways to scale resources and manage workloads in a cluster. We'll cover three main mechanisms for autoscaling:

- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Cluster Proportional Autoscaler (CPA)
- Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)

In this chapter, we'll explore the process of configuring and using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), the Cluster Proportional Autoscaler (CPA) and Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) to manage workloads in a cluster.
