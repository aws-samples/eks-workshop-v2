**AWS Load Balancer Controller** is a [controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) to help manage Elastic Load Balancers for a Kubernetes cluster.

The controller can provision the following resources:

- An AWS Application Load Balancer when you create a Kubernetes `Ingress`.
- An AWS Network Load Balancer when you create a Kubernetes `Service` of type `LoadBalancer`.

Application Load Balancers work at `L7` of the OSI model, allowing you to expose Kubernetes service using ingress rules, and supports external-facing traffic. Network load balancers work at `L4` of the OSI model, allowing you to leverage Kubernetes `Services` to expose a set of pods as an application network service.

The controller enables you to simplify operations and save costs by sharing an Application Load Balancer across multiple applications in your Kubernetes cluster.

The AWS Load Balancer Controller has already been installed in our cluster, so we can get started creating resources.

:::info
The AWS Load Balancer Controller was formerly named the AWS ALB Ingress Controller.
