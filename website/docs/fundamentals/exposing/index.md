Right now our web store application is not exposed to the outside world, so there's no way for users to access it. Although there are many microservices in our web store workload, only the `ui` application needs to be available to end users. This is because the `ui` application will perform all communication to the other backend services using internal Kubernetes networking.

In this chapter of the workshop we'll take a look at the various mechanisms available when using EKS to expose an application to end users.
