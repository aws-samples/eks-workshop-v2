title: Run pods on Graviton
sidebar_position: 20

Now that we have tainted our Graviton node group, we'll need to configure our application to take advantage of this change. To do so, let's configure our application to deploy the `ui` microservice only on nodes that are part of our Graviton-based managed node group. 

Before making any changes, let's check the current configuration for the UI pods. Keep in mind that these pods are being controlled by an associated deployment named `ui`.

```bash
$ kubectl describe pod --namespace ui --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ui
Name:             ui-7bdbf967f9-qzh7f
Namespace:        ui
Priority:         0
Service Account:  ui
Node:             ip-10-42-11-43.us-west-2.compute.internal/10.42.11.43

                  app.kubernetes.io/created-by=eks-workshop
                  app.kubernetes.io/instance=ui
                  app.kubernetes.io/name=ui
                  pod-template-hash=7bdbf967f9

Node-Selectors:              <none>
Tolerations:                 node.kubernetes.io/not-ready:NoExecute op=Exists for 300s
                             node.kubernetes.io/unreachable:NoExecute op=Exists for 300s
```

As anticipated, the application is running succesfully on a non-tainted node. The associated pod is in a `Running` status and we can confirm that no custom tolerations have been configured. Note that Kubernetes automatically adds tolerations for `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` and `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` with `tolerationSeconds=300`, unless you or a controller set those tolerations explicitly. These automatically-added tolerations mean that Pods remain bound to Nodes for 5 minutes after one of these problems is detected.

Let's update our `ui` deployment to bind its pods to our tainted managed node group. We have pre-configured our tainted managed node group with a label of `tainted=yes` that we can use with a `nodeSelector`. The following `Kustomize` patch describes the changes needed to our deployment configuration in order to enable this setup: 

```kustomization
modules/fundamentals/mng/graviton/nodeselector-wo-toleration/deployment.yaml
Deployment/ui
```

To apply the Kustomize changes run the following command: 

```bash
$ kubectl apply -k ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/fundamentals/mng/graviton/nodeselector-wo-toleration/
namespace/ui unchanged
serviceaccount/ui unchanged
configmap/ui unchanged
service/ui unchanged
deployment.apps/ui configured
```

With our recently made changes, let's check the rollout status of our UI deployment:

```bash
$ kubectl --namespace ui rollout status --watch=false deployment/ui
Waiting for deployment "ui" rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
```

Given the default `RollingUpdate` strategy for our `ui` deployment, the K8s deployment will wait for the newly created pod to be in `Ready` state before terminating the old one. The deployment rollout seems stuck so let's investigate further: 

```bash hook=pending-pod
$ kubectl get pod --namespace ui -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ui
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ui-659df48c56-z496x   0/1     Pending   0          16s
ui-795bd46545-mrglh   1/1     Running   0          8m
```

Investigating the individual pods under the `ui` namespace we can observe that one pod is in `Pending` state. Diving deeper into the `Pending` Pod's details provides some information on the experienced issue.  

```bash
$ podname=$(kubectl get pod --namespace ui --field-selector=status.phase=Pending -o json | \
                jq -r '.items[0].metadata.name') && \
                kubectl describe pod $podname -n ui
Name:           ui-659df48c56-z496x

  Warning  FailedScheduling  19s   default-scheduler  0/4 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had untolerated taint {frontend: true}, 3 node(s) didn't match Pod's node affinity/selector. preemption: 0/4 nodes are available: 4 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.
```

Our changes are reflected in the new configuration of the `Pending` pod. We can see that we have pinned the pod to any node with the `tainted=yes` label but this introduced a new problem as our pod cannot be scheduled (`PodScheduled False`). A more useful explanation can be found under the `events`:
```
0/4 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had untolerated taint {frontend: true}, 3 node(s) didn't match Pod's node affinity/selector. preemption: 0/4 nodes are available: 4 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.
```

To fix this, we need to add a toleration. Let's ensure our deployment and associated pods are able to tolerate the `frontend: true` taint. We can use the below `kustomize` patch to make the necessary changes:
 
```kustomization
modules/fundamentals/mng/graviton/nodeselector-w-toleration/deployment.yaml
Deployment/ui
```


```bash
$ kubectl apply -k ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/fundamentals/mng/graviton/nodeselector-w-toleration/
namespace/ui unchanged
serviceaccount/ui unchanged
configmap/ui unchanged
service/ui unchanged
deployment.apps/ui configured
$ kubectl --namespace ui rollout status deployment/ui --timeout=120s
```

Checking the UI pod, we can see that the configuration now includes the specified toleration (`frontend=true:NoExecute`) and it is succesfully scheduled on the node with corresponding taint. The following commands can be used for validation:  

```bash
$ kubectl get pod --namespace ui -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ui
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ui-6c5c9f6b5f-7jxp8   1/1     Running   0          29s
```

As you can see, the `ui` pod is now running on the Graviton-based node group. In addition, you can see the Taints on the `kubectl describe node` command, and the matching Tolerations on the `kubectl describe pod` command.

You've successfully scheduled the `ui` application, which can run on both Intel and ARM-based processors, to run on the new Graviton-based managed node group we created in the previous step. Taints and tolerations are a powerful tool that can be used to configure how pods get scheduled onto nodes, whether it's for Graviton/GPU-enhanced nodes, or for multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters.
