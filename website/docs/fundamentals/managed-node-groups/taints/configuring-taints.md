For the purpose of this exercise, we have provisioned a separate managed node group that current has no nodes running. Use the following command to scale the node group up to 1:

```bash hook=configure-taints
$ eksctl scale nodegroup --name $EKS_TAINTED_MNG_NAME --cluster $EKS_CLUSTER_NAME --nodes 1 --nodes-min 0 --nodes-max 1
```

Now check the status of the node group:

```bash
$ eksctl get nodegroup --name $EKS_TAINTED_MNG_NAME --cluster $EKS_CLUSTER_NAME
CLUSTER			NODEGROUP						STATUS	CREATED			MIN SIZE	MAX SIZE	DESIRED CAPACITY	INSTANCE TYPE	IMAGE ID		ASG NAME									TYPE
eks-workshop	managed-ondemand-tainted-20221103142426393800000006	ACTIVE	2022-11-03T14:24:28Z	0		1		1			m5.large	ami-0b55230f107a87100	eks-managed-ondemand-tainted-20221103142426393800000006-d0c21ef0-8024-f793-52a9-3ed57ca9d457	managed
```

It will take *2-3* minutes for the node to join the EKS cluster, until you see this command give the following output:

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes \
    --label-columns eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup \
    --selector eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup=$EKS_TAINTED_MNG_NAME
NAME                                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION               NODEGROUP
ip-10-42-12-233.eu-west-1.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   63m   v1.23.9-eks-ba74326   managed-ondemand-tainted-20221103142426393800000006
```

The above command makes use of the `--selector` flag to query for all nodes that have a label of `eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup` that matches the name of our managed node group `$EKS_TAINTED_MNG_NAME`. The `--label-columns` flag also allows us to display the value of the `eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup` label in the node list. 

Before configuring our taints, let's explore the current configuration of our node. Note that the following command will list the details of all nodes that are part of our managed node group. In our lab, the managed node group has just one instance. 

```bash
$ kubectl describe nodes \
    --selector eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup=$EKS_TAINTED_MNG_NAME
Name:               ip-10-42-12-233.eu-west-1.compute.internal
Roles:              <none>
Labels:             beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64
                    beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=m5.large
                    beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux
                    eks.amazonaws.com/capacityType=ON_DEMAND
                    eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup=managed-ondemand-tainted-20221103142426393800000006
                    eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup-image=ami-0b55230f107a87100
                    eks.amazonaws.com/sourceLaunchTemplateId=lt-07afc97c4940b6622
                    [...]
CreationTimestamp:  Wed, 09 Nov 2022 10:36:26 +0000
Taints:             <none>
[...]
```

A few things to point out:

1. EKS automatically adds certain labels to allow for easier filtering, including labels for the OS type, managed node group name, instance type and others. While certain labels are provided out-of-the-box with EKS, AWS allows operators to configure their own set of custom labels at the managed node group level. This ensures that every node within a node group will have consistent labels. 
2. Currently, there are no taints configured for the explored node, showcased by the `Taints: <none>` stanza. 

## Configuring taints for Managed Node Groups

While it's easy to taint nodes using the `kubectl` CLI as described [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/#concepts), an administrator will have to make this change every time the underlying node group scales up or down. To overcome this challenge, AWS supports adding both `labels` and `taints` to managed node groups, ensuring every node within the MNG will have the associated labels and taints configured automatically. 

In the next few sections, we'll explore how to add taints to our preconfigured managed node group `$EKS_TAINTED_MNG_NAME`. 

Let's start by adding a `taint` to our managed node group using the following `aws` cli command: 

```bash timeout=180
$ aws eks update-nodegroup-config \
    --cluster-name $EKS_CLUSTER_NAME \
    --nodegroup-name $EKS_TAINTED_MNG_NAME \
    --taints "addOrUpdateTaints=[{key=frontend, value=true, effect=NO_EXECUTE}]"
{
    "update": {
        "id": "488a2b7d-9194-3032-974e-2f1056ef9a1b",
        "status": "InProgress",
        "type": "ConfigUpdate",
        "params": [
            {
                "type": "TaintsToAdd",
                "value": "[{\"effect\":\"NO_EXECUTE\",\"value\":\"true\",\"key\":\"frontend\"}]"
            }
        ],
        "createdAt": "2022-11-09T15:20:10.519000+00:00",
        "errors": []
    }
}
$ aws eks wait nodegroup-active --cluster-name $EKS_CLUSTER_NAME \
  --nodegroup-name $EKS_TAINTED_MNG_NAME
```

The addition, removal, or replacement of taints can be done by using the [`aws eks update-nodegroup-config`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/eks/update-nodegroup-config.html) CLI command to update the configuration of the managed node group. This can be done by passing either `addOrUpdateTaints` or `removeTaints` and a list of taints to the `--taints` command flag. 

The above command will add a new taint with the key of `frontend`, value of `true` and effect of `NO_EXECUTE`. This ensures that pods will not be able to be scheduled on any nodes that are part of the managed node group without having the corresponding toleration. Also, any existing pods without a matching toleration will be evicted. 

:::tip
You can also configure taints on a managed node group using the `eksctl` CLI. See the [docs](https://eksctl.io/usage/nodegroup-taints/) for more info.
:::

The configuration for managed node groups currently support the folowing values for the taint `effect`:
* `NO_SCHEDULE` - This corresponds to the Kubernetes `NoSchedule` taint effect. This configures the managed node group with a taint that repels all pods that don't have a matching toleration. All running pods are **not evicted from the manage node group's nodes**.
* `NO_EXECUTE` - This corresponds to the Kubernetes `NoExecute` taint effect. Allows nodes configured with this taint to not only repel newly scheduled pods but also **evicts any running pods without a matching toleration**.
* `PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE` - This corresponds to the Kubernetes `PreferNoSchedule` taint effect. If possible, EKS avoids scheduling Pods that do not tolerate this taint onto the node.

We can use the following command to check the taints have been correctly configured for the managed node group:

```bash
$ aws eks describe-nodegroup \
  --cluster-name $EKS_CLUSTER_NAME \
  --nodegroup-name $EKS_TAINTED_MNG_NAME \
  | jq .nodegroup.taints
[
  {
    "key": "frontend",
    "value": "true",
    "effect": "NO_EXECUTE"
  }
]
```

:::info

Updating the managed node group and propagating the labels and taints usually takes a few minutes. If you're not seeing any taints configured or getting a `null` value, please do wait a few minutes before trying the above command again. 

:::

Verifying with the `kubectl` cli command, we can also see that the taint has been correctly propagated to the associated node:

```bash
$ kubectl describe nodes \
    --selector eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup=$EKS_TAINTED_MNG_NAME | grep Taints
Taints:             frontend=true:NoExecute
```
