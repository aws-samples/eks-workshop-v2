In this section, we'll learn how to troubleshoot some of the most common pod issues which prevent the containerized application from running in an Amazon EKS cluster, such as ImagePullBackOff and stuck in ContainerCreating state.

:::tip Before you start
Prepare your environment for this section:

```bash timeout=600 wait=300
$ prepare-environment troubleshooting/pod
```

You can view the Terraform that applies these changes [here](https://github.com/VAR::MANIFESTS_OWNER/VAR::MANIFESTS_REPOSITORY/tree/VAR::MANIFESTS_REF/manifests/modules/troubleshooting/pod/.workshop/terraform).

- Create a new deployment named ui-private in default namespace.
- Create a new deployment named ui-new in default namespace
- Install aws-efs-csi-driver addon in the EKS cluster.
- Create a EFS filesystem and mount targets.
- Introduce an issue to the deployment spec, so we can learn how to troubleshoot this type of issue.
- Introduce an issue to the deployment spec, so we can learn how to troubleshoot these types of issues
