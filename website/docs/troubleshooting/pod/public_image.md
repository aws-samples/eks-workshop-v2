In this section we will learn how to troubleshoot the pod ImagePullBackOff error for a ECR public image. Now let's verify if the deployment is created, so we can start troubleshooting the scenario.

```bash
$ kubectl get deployment ui-new -n default
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ui-new   0/1     1            0           75s
```

:::info
If you get the same output, it means you are ready to start the troubleshooting.

The task for you in this troubleshooting section is to find the cause for the deployment ui-new to be in 0/1 ready state and to fix it, so that the deployment will have one pod ready and running.

## Let's start the troubleshooting

### Step 1: Check pod status

First, we need to verify the status of our pods using `kubectl` tool.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -l app=app-new
NAME                      READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
ui-new-5654dd8969-7w98k   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          13s
```

### Step 2: Describe the pod

You can see that the pod status is showing as ImagePullBackOff. Let's describe the pod to see the events.

```bash expectError=true timeout=20
$ POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=app-new -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'`
$ kubectl describe pod $POD | awk '/Events:/,/^$/'
Events:
  Type     Reason     Age                From               Message
  ----     ------     ----               ----               -------
  Normal   Scheduled  48s                default-scheduler  Successfully assigned default/ui-new-5654dd8969-7w98k to ip-10-42-33-232.us-west-2.compute.internal
  Normal   BackOff    23s (x2 over 47s)  kubelet            Back-off pulling image "public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retailing-store-sample-ui:0.4.0"
  Warning  Failed     23s (x2 over 47s)  kubelet            Error: ImagePullBackOff
  Normal   Pulling    12s (x3 over 47s)  kubelet            Pulling image "public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retailing-store-sample-ui:0.4.0"
  Warning  Failed     12s (x3 over 47s)  kubelet            Failed to pull image "public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retailing-store-sample-ui:0.4.0": rpc error: code = NotFound desc = failed to pull and unpack image "public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retailing-store-sample-ui:0.4.0": failed to resolve reference "public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retailing-store-sample-ui:0.4.0": public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retailing-store-sample-ui:0.4.0: not found
  Warning  Failed     12s (x3 over 47s)  kubelet            Error: ErrImagePull
```

From the events of the pod, we can see the "Failed to pull image" warning with error code NotFound. This indicates that the referenced image in the pod/deployment spec was not found at the path.

### Step 3: Check the image reference

Let's check the image used by the pod.

```bash
$ kubectl get pod $POD -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].image}'
public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retailing-store-sample-ui:0.4.0
```

From the image URI, we can see that the image is referenced from public ECR repository of AWS.

### Step 4: Verify image existence

Let's check if image named retailing-store-sample-ui with tag 0.4.0 exists at [aws-containers ECR](https://gallery.ecr.aws/aws-containers). Search for the "retailing-store-sample-ui" and you will notice that no such image repository shows up. You can also easily verify the image existence in public ECR by using the image URI in a browser. In our case [image-uri](https://gallery.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retailing-store-sample-ui) will show a "Repository not found" message.

### Step 5: Update the deployment with the correct image

To resolve the issue, we will have to update the deployment/pod spec with correct image reference. In our case it is public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-ui:0.4.0.

#### 5.1. Verify if image exists

Before we update the deployment, let's verify if this image exists using above mentioned method i.e. by visiting the [image-uri](https://gallery.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-ui). You should be able to see the retail-store-sample-ui image with multiple tags available, including 0.4.0.

![RepoExist](assets/repo-found.webp)

#### 5.1. Update image in the deployment with correct reference

```bash
$ kubectl patch deployment ui-new --patch '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"containers": [{"name": "ui", "image": "public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-ui:0.4.0"}]}}}}'
deployment.apps/ui-new patched
```

### Step 6: Verify the fix

Verify the new pod is created and running successfully.

```bash timeout=180 hook=fix-1 hookTimeout=600 wait=20
$ kubectl get pods -l app=app-new
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ui-new-77856467b-2z2s6   1/1     Running   0          13s
```

## Wrapping it up

General troubleshooting workflow of the pod with ImagePullBackOff on public image includes:

- Check the pod events for a clue on cause of the issue such as "not found", "access denied" or "timeout".
- If "not found", ensure that the image exists in the path referenced.
- For "access denied", check the permissions on worker node role.
- For timeout on public images on ECR, ensure that the worker node networking is configured to reach the internet via IGW/TGW/NAT.
