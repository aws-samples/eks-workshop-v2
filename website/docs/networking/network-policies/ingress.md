As shown in the architecture diagram, the 'catalog' namespace receives traffic only from the 'ui' namespace and from no other namespace. Also, the 'catalog' database component can only receive traffic from the 'catalog' service component.

We can start implementing the above network rules using an ingress network policy that will control traffic to the 'catalog' namespace.

Before applying the policy, the 'catalog' service can be accessed by both the 'ui' component:

```bash
$ kubectl exec deployment/ui -n ui -- curl -v catalog.catalog/health --connect-timeout 5
   Trying XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:80...
* Connected to catalog.catalog (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX) port 80 (#0)
> GET /catalogue HTTP/1.1
> Host: catalog.catalog
> User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
> Accept: */*
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

As well as the 'orders' component:

```bash
$ kubectl exec deployment/orders -n orders -- curl -v catalog.catalog/health --connect-timeout 5
   Trying XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:80...
* Connected to catalog.catalog (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX) port 80 (#0)
> GET /catalogue HTTP/1.1
> Host: catalog.catalog
> User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
> Accept: */*
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

Now, we'll define a network policy that will allow traffic to the 'catalog' service component only from the 'ui' component:

```file
manifests/modules/networking/network-policies/apply-network-policies/allow-catalog-ingress-webservice.yaml
```

Lets apply the policy:

```bash wait=30
$ kubectl apply -f ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/networking/network-policies/apply-network-policies/allow-catalog-ingress-webservice.yaml
```

Now, we can validate the policy by confirming that we can still access the 'catalog' component from the 'ui':

```bash
$ kubectl exec deployment/ui -n ui -- curl -v catalog.catalog/health --connect-timeout 5
  Trying XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:80...
* Connected to catalog.catalog (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX) port 80 (#0)
> GET /catalogue HTTP/1.1
> Host: catalog.catalog
> User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
> Accept: */*
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

But not from the 'orders' component:

```bash expectError=true
$ kubectl exec deployment/orders -n orders -- curl -v catalog.catalog/health --connect-timeout 5
*   Trying XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:80...
* ipv4 connect timeout after 4999ms, move on!
* Failed to connect to catalog.catalog port 80 after 5001 ms: Timeout was reached
* Closing connection 0
curl: (28) Failed to connect to catalog.catalog port 80 after 5001 ms: Timeout was reached
...
```
As you could see from the above outputs, only the 'ui' component is able to communicate with the 'catalog' service component, and the 'orders' service component is not able to.

But this still leaves the 'catalog' database component open, so let us implement a network policy to ensure only the 'catalog' service component alone can communicate with the 'catalog' database component.

```file
manifests/modules/networking/network-policies/apply-network-policies/allow-catalog-ingress-db.yaml
```

Lets apply the policy:

```bash wait=30
$ kubectl apply -f ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/networking/network-policies/apply-network-policies/allow-catalog-ingress-db.yaml
```

Let us validate the network policy by confirming we cannot connect to the 'catalog' database from the 'orders' component:

```bash expectError=true
$ kubectl exec deployment/orders -n orders -- curl -v telnet://catalog-mysql.catalog:3306 --connect-timeout 5
*   Trying XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:3306...
* ipv4 connect timeout after 4999ms, move on!
* Failed to connect to catalog-mysql.catalog port 3306 after 5001 ms: Timeout was reached
* Closing connection 0
curl: (28) Failed to connect to catalog-mysql.catalog port 3306 after 5001 ms: Timeout was reached
command terminated with exit code 28
...
```

But if we restart the 'catalog' pod it can still connect:

```bash
$ kubectl rollout restart deployment/catalog -n catalog
$ kubectl rollout status deployment/catalog -n catalog --timeout=2m
```

As you could see from the above outputs, only the 'catalog' service component alone is able to communicate with the 'catalog' database component.

Now that we have implemented an effective ingress policy for the 'catalog' namespace, we extend the same logic to other namespaces and components in the sample application, thereby greatly reducing the attack surface for the sample application and increasing network security.
