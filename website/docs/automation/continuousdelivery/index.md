Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.

Companies can automate changes to their application in EKS cluster via a continuous delivery mechanism, without needing to intervene in between and apply any changes to their cluster manually.

In this section, we will review how users can configure their software development lifecycle from managing their source code, creating of image and deployment to EKS cluster through AWS Continuous delivery service (CodePipeline).
