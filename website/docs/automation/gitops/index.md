Companies want to go fast; they need to deploy more often, more reliably, and preferably with less overhead. GitOps is a fast and secure method for developers to manage and update complex applications and infrastructure running in Kubernetes.

GitOps is an operations and application deployment workflow and a set of best practices for managing both infrastructure and deployments for cloud-native applications. This post is divided into two parts. In the first part, we provide you with the history of GitOps as well as a description of how it works and what the benefits are. In the second part, you can try it out for yourself with a hands-on tutorial that describes how to set up a continuous deployment pipeline with Flux to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).

What is GitOps? Coined by Weaveworks CEO, Alexis Richardson, GitOps is an operating model for Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies. It provides a set of best practices that unifies deployment, management, and monitoring for clusters and applications.  Another way to put it is: a path towards a developer experience for managing applications; where end-to-end CI and CD pipelines and Git workflows are applied to both operations, and development.
