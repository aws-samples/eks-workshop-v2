We have successfully configured Argo CD on our cluster so now we can deploy an application. To demonstrate the difference between a GitOps-based delivery of an application and other methods, we'll migrate the UI component of the sample application which is currently using the `kubectl apply -k` approach to the new Argo CD deployment approach.

First let's remove the existing UI component so we can replace it:

```bash
$ kubectl delete -k ~/environment/eks-workshop/base-application/ui --ignore-not-found=true
namespace "ui" deleted
serviceaccount "ui" deleted
configmap "ui" deleted
service "ui" deleted
deployment.apps "ui" deleted
```

Now, let's get into the cloned Git repository and start creating our GitOps configuration. Copy the existing kustomize configuration for the UI service:

```bash
$ cp -R ~/environment/eks-workshop/base-application/ui/* ~/environment/argocd/apps
```

Your Git directory should now look something like this which you can validate by running `tree ~/environment/argocd`:

```
.
└── apps
    ├── configMap.yaml
    ├── deployment.yaml
    ├── kustomization.yaml
    ├── namespace.yaml
    ├── serviceAccount.yaml
    └── service.yaml

1 directory, 6 files
```

Open the Argo CD UI and navigate to the `apps` application.

Finally we can push our configuration to the Git repository:

```bash
$ git -C ~/environment/argocd add .
$ git -C ~/environment/argocd commit -am "Adding the UI service"
$ git -C ~/environment/argocd push
```

Click `Refresh` and `Sync` in ArgoCD UI or use `argocd` CLI to `Sync` the application:

```bash
$ argocd app sync apps
```

After a short period of time, the application should be in `Synced` state and the resources should be deployed, the UI should look like this:

That shows that Argo CD created the basic kustomization, and that it's in sync with the cluster.

We've now successfully migrated the UI component to deploy using Argo CD, and any further changes pushed to the Git repository will be automatically reconciled to our EKS cluster.

You should now have all the resources related to the UI services deployed. To verify, run the following commands:

```bash hook=deploy
$ kubectl get deployment -n ui ui
NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ui     1/1     1            1           61s
$ kubectl get pod -n ui
NAME                 READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
ui-6d5bb7b95-rjfxd   1/1     Running  0          62s
```
