$ prepare-environment automation/controlplanes/crossplane
```

This will make the following changes to your lab environment:

- Install Crossplane and the AWS provider in the Amazon EKS cluster

You can view the Terraform that applies these changes [here](https://github.com/VAR::MANIFESTS_OWNER/VAR::MANIFESTS_REPOSITORY/tree/VAR::MANIFESTS_REF/manifests/modules/automation/controlplanes/crossplane/.workshop/terraform).

:::

[Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) is an open source project in the CNCF that transforms your Kubernetes cluster into a universal control plane. Crossplane enables platform teams to assemble infrastructure from multiple vendors, and expose higher level self-service APIs for application teams to consume, without having to write any code.
Crossplane extends your Kubernetes cluster to support orchestrating any infrastructure or managed service. Compose Crossplaneâ€™s granular resources into higher level abstractions that can be versioned, managed, deployed and consumed using your favorite tools and existing processes.
