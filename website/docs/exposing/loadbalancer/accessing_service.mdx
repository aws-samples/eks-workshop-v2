Now that our application is exposed to the outside world, lets try to access it.

Get the URL from the `Service` resource:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system get svc -n ui ui-nlb -o json | jq \
  -r '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname'
k8s-ui-uinlb-a9797f0f61.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

And access it in your web browser. You will see the UI from the web store displayed and will be able to navigate around the site as a user.
