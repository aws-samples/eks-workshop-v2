Run the following command to setup the EKS cluster for this module:

```bash timeout=300 wait=30
reset-environment
```

Currently there are no `Ingress` resources in our cluster, which you can check with the following command:

```bash expectError=true
kubectl get ingress -A
No resources found
```

There are also no `Service` resources of type `LoadBalancer`, which you can confirm with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get svc -A
```
