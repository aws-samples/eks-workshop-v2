This finding informs you that your EKS Cluster dashboard was exposed to the internet by a Load Balancer service. An exposed dashboard makes the management interface of your cluster publicly accessible from the internet and allows bad actors to exploit any authentication and access control gaps that may be present.

To simulate this we will need install the Kubernetes dashboard component. We'll be using the version v2.7.0 of the dashboard, which is latest compatible with EKS Cluster vVAR::KUBERNETES_VERSION based on the [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/releases/tag/v2.7.0).
After that we can expose the dashboard to the Internet with Service type `LoadBalancer`, which will create a Network Load Banacer(NLB) in your AWS Account.

Run the follwoing commands, to install the Kubernetes dashboard component. This will create a new Namespace called `kubernetes-dashboard`, and all the resources will be deployed there.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.7.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
$ kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard rollout status deployment/kubernetes-dashboard
$ kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get pods
NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dashboard-metrics-scraper-64bcc67c9c-tt9vl   1/1     Running   0          66s
kubernetes-dashboard-5c8bd6b59-945zj         1/1     Running   0          66s
```

Now, let us patch the newly created `kubernetes-dashboard` Service to be type `LoadBalancer`.

```bash
$ kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard patch svc kubernetes-dashboard -p='{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

After a couple of minutes, the NLB will be created and show a publicly accessible address in the `kubernetes-dashboard` Service.

```bash
$ kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get svc
NAME                        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)         AGE
dashboard-metrics-scraper   ClusterIP      172.20.8.169     <none>                                                                    8000/TCP        3m
kubernetes-dashboard        LoadBalancer   172.20.218.132   ad0fbc5914a2c4d1baa8dcc32101196b-2094501166.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com   443:32762/TCP   3m1s
```

If you go back to the [GuardDuty Findings console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/home#/findings), you will see the finding `Policy:Kubernetes/ExposedDashboard`. Again use sometime to analyze the Finding details, Action, and Detective Investigation.

Uninstall the Kubernetes dashboard components running the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.7.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
