This finding indicates that a container tried to do a crypto mining inside a Pod.

To simulate the finding we'll be running a `ubuntu` image Pod in the `default` namespace and from there run a couple of commands to simulate downloading a crypto mining process.

Run the below command to start the Pod:

```bash
$ kubectl run crypto -n other --image ubuntu --restart=Never --command -- sleep infinity
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod crypto -n other
```

Next we can use `kubectl exec` to run a series of commands inside the Pod. First lets install the `curl` utility:

```bash
$ kubectl exec crypto -n other -- bash -c 'apt update && apt install -y curl'
```

Next lets download the crypto mining process but dump the output to `/dev/null`:

```bash test=false
$ kubectl exec crypto -n other -- bash -c 'curl -s -o /dev/null http://us-east.equihash-hub.miningpoolhub.com:12026 || true && echo "Done!"'
```

These commands will trigger three different findings in the [GuardDuty Findings console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/home#/findings).

The first one is `Execution:Runtime/NewBinaryExecuted` which is related to the `curl` package installed via the APT tool.

Take a closer look to the details of this finding, which because they are related to the GuardDuty runtime monitoring show specific information regarding the runtime, context, and processes.

The second and third ones are related to `CryptoCurrency:Runtime/BitcoinTool.B!DNS` findings. Notice again that the finding details brings different information, this time showing the `DNS_REQUEST` action, and the **Threat intelligence Evidences**.
