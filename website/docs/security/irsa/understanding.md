The first place to look for the issue is the logs of the `carts` service:

```bash
kubectl logs -n carts deployment/carts
```

This will return a lot of logs, so lets filter it down a little to get a succinct view of the problem:

```bash
kubectl -n carts logs deployment/carts \
  | grep AmazonDynamoDBException

Our application is generating an `AccessDeniedException` which indicates that the IAM role our Pod is using to access DynamoDB does not have the required permissions. This is happening because our Pod is by default using the IAM role assigned to the EC2 worker node on which its running, which does not have an IAM policy that allows access to DynamoDB.

One way we could solve this is to expand the IAM permissions of our EC2 worker nodes, but this would allow any Pod that runs on them to access our DynamoDB table. That isn't very secure. Instead we'll using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) to specifically allow the Pods in our `carts` service access.
