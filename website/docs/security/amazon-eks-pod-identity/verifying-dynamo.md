Now, with the `carts` Service Account associated with the authorized IAM Role, the `carts` Pod has permission to access the DynamoDB table. Access the web store again and navigate to the shopping cart.

```bash
$ kubectl -n ui get service ui-nlb -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].hostname}{"\n"}'
k8s-ui-uinlb-647e781087-6717c5049aa96bd9.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

The `carts` Pod is able to reach the DynamoDB service and the shopping cart is now accessible!

After the AWS IAM role is associated with the Service Account, any newly created Pods using that Service Account will be intercepted by the [EKS Pod Identity webhook](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook). This webhook runs on the Amazon EKS clusterâ€™s control plane, and is fully managed by AWS. Take a closer look at the new `carts` Pod to see the new environment variables.

```bash
$ kubectl -n carts exec deployment/carts -- env | grep AWS
AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS=regional
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
AWS_REGION=us-west-2
AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI=http://169.254.170.23/v1/credentials
AWS_CONTAINER_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN_FILE=/var/run/secrets/pods.eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount/eks-pod-identity-token
```

Things that are worth noting are:

- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` The region is set automatically to the same as our EKS cluster
- `AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS` regional STS endpoints are configured to avoid putting too much pressure on the global endpoint in `us-east-1`
- `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI` variable tells AWS SDKs how to obtains credentials using [HTTP credential provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-container-credentials.html). This means that EKS Pod Identity does not need to inject credentials via something like an `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` pair, and instead the SDKs can have temporary credentials vending to them via EKS Pod Identity mechanism. You can read more about how this functions in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-identities.html).

You have successfully configured Pod Identity in your Application!!!
