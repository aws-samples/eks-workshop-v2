Security at AWS is the highest priority, and is a shared responsibility between AWS and our customers. When using a managed service like Amazon EKS, AWS is responsible for security "of" the cloud whereas you, the customer, are responsible for security "in" the cloud.

In this chapter, we'll explore various aspects of Amazon EKS related to security. To learn more about security with EKS refer to the [EKS Best Practices Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/).
