As discussed, in the Introduction to [Pod Security Standards](../pod-security-standards/), Policy levels are defined in 3 levels, Baseline, Restricted and Privileged. While it is recommended to setup a Restricted PSS, it can cause unintended behavior on the application level unless properly set. To get started it is recommended to setup a Baseline Policy that will prevent known Privileged escalations such as Containers accessing HostProcess, HostPath, HostPorts or allow traffic snooping and much more.

We can setup individual policies to restrict/disallow the privilege access to containers mentioned above. A Kyverno Baseline Policy will help to restrict all the known privileged escalation under a single policy. It also maintains and updates the Policy regularly which adds the latest vulnerabilities to the Policy.

Generally, Privileged containers are often used in CI/CD pipelines to allow for building and publishing Container images.
With the now fixed [CVE-2022-23648](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-crp2-qrr5-8pq7) any bad actor, could escape the privileged container by abusing the Control Groups `release_agent` functionality to execute arbitrary commands on the container host.

A privileged container, can do almost everything that the host can do. In our example, we will create a privileged Pod on our EKS cluster.

```file
manifests/modules/security/kyverno/baseline-policy/privileged-pod.yaml
```

Create the Pod, using the following command.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/eks-workshop-v2/main/manifests/modules/security/kyverno/baseline-policy/privileged-pod.yaml

pod/privileged-pod created
```

Next we will access the Pod using the `kubectl exec` command.

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it privileged-pod -- bash
[root@privileged-pod /]#
```

Notice, that the container is running as the **root** user by default.

Inside the Pod, run the `capsh --print` to validate the privileges granted to the Pod.

```bash
$ capsh --print
Current: = cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_linux_immutable,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_broadcast,cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_ipc_lock,cap_ipc_owner,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_chroot,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_pacct,cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_boot,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_time,cap_sys_tty_config,cap_mknod,cap_lease,cap_audit_write,cap_audit_control,cap_setfcap,cap_mac_override,cap_mac_admin,cap_syslog,cap_wake_alarm,cap_block_suspend,cap_audit_read,38,39,40+ep

uid=0(root)

```

Exit the Pod, and delete it from the cluster.

```bash
$ exit
$ kubectl delete pod privileged-pod
```

In order to avoid such escalated privileged situations and avoid unauthorized use of above permissions, it's recommended to setup a Baseline Policy using Kyverno.

The baseline profile of the Pod Security Standards is a collection of the most basic and important steps that can be taken to secure Pods. Beginning with Kyverno 1.8, an entire profile may be assigned to the cluster through a single rule. To check more on the privileges blocked by Baseline Profile, please refer [here](https://kyverno.io/policies/#:~:text=Baseline%20Pod%20Security%20Standards,cluster%20through%20a%20single%20rule)

```file
manifests/modules/security/kyverno/baseline-policy/baseline-policy.yaml
```

Notice that he above policy is in `Enforce` mode, and will block any requests to create privileged Pod.

Go ahead and apply the Baseline Policy.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/eks-workshop-v2/main/manifests/modules/security/kyverno/baseline-policy/baseline-policy.yaml

clusterpolicy.kyverno.io/baseline-policy created
```

Now, try to create the privileged Pod again.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/eks-workshop-v2/main/manifests/modules/security/kyverno/baseline-policy/privileged-pod.yaml

Error from server: error when creating "STDIN": admission webhook "validate.kyverno.svc-fail" denied the request: 

resource Pod/default/privileged-pod was blocked due to the following policies 

baseline-policy:
  baseline: |
    Validation rule 'baseline' failed. It violates PodSecurity "baseline:latest": ({Allowed:false ForbiddenReason:privileged ForbiddenDetail:container "privileged-pod" must not set securityContext.privileged=true})
```

> **hostIPC**: The Host IPC namespace controls whether a Pod's containers can be shared with the underlying host

As seen the creation failed, because it isn't in compliance with our Baseline Policy set on the Cluster.

### Note on Auto-Generated Policies

PSA operates at the Pod level, but in practice Pods are usually managed by pod controllers, like Deployments. Having no indication of pod security errors at the pod controller level makes issues complex to troubleshoot. The PSA enforce mode is the only PSA mode that stops pods from being created; however, PSA enforce doesnâ€™t act on controller resources that create pods. To help this user experience, we recommend that PSA `warn` and `audit` modes are also used with `enforce`; PSA warn and audit modes will at least indicate that pod-creating controller resources are trying to create Pods that would otherwise fail the applied PSS level. This user experience can present a challenge to adopters of the PSA/PSS features.

Using PaC solutions with Kubernetes presents another challenge of writing and maintaining policies to cover all the different Kubernetes resources used within clusters. With the [Kyverno Auto-Gen Rules for Pod Controllers](https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/autogen/) feature, the above pod policies auto-generate associated pod controller (Deployment, DaemonSet, etc.) policies. This Kyverno feature increases the expressive nature of policies, and reduces the effort to maintain policies for associated resources. These additional auto-generated policies also improve the above-mentioned PSA user experience where pod-creating resources are not prevented from progressing, while the underlying pods are prevented.
