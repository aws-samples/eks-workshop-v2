To get an understanding of Kyverno Policies, we will start our lab with a simple Pod Label requirement. As you may know, Labels in Kubernetes can be used to tag objects and resources in the Cluster.

Below we have a sample policy requiring a Label `CostCenter`.

```file
manifests/modules/security/kyverno/simple-policy/require-labels-policy.yaml
```

Kyverno has 2 kinds of Policy resources, **ClusterPolicy** used for Cluster-Wide Resources and **Policy** used for Namespaced Resources. The example above shows a ClusterPolicy. Take sometime to dive deep and check the below details in the configuration.

- Under the spec section of the Policy, there is a an attribute `validationFailureAction` it tells Kyverno if the resource being validated should be allowed but reported `Audit` or blocked `Enforce`. Defaults to Audit, the example is set to Enforce.
- The `rules` is one or more rules to be validated.
- The `match` statement sets the scope of what will be checked. In this case, it is any `Pod` resource.
- The `validate` statement tries to positively check what is defined. If the statement, when compared with the requested resource, is true, it is allowed. If false, it is blocked.
- The `message` is what gets displayed to a user if this rule fails validation.
- The `pattern` object defines what pattern will be checked in the resource. In this case, it is looking for `metadata.labels` with `CostCenter`.

The Above Example Policy, will block any Pod Creation which doesn't have the label `CostCenter`.

Create the policy using the following command.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/security/kyverno/simple-policy/require-labels-policy.yaml

clusterpolicy.kyverno.io/require-labels created
```

Next, take a look on the Pods running in the `ui` Namespace, notice the applied labels.

```bash
$ kubectl -n ui get pods --show-labels
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
ui-67d8cf77cf-d4j47   1/1     Running   0          9m    app.kubernetes.io/component=service,app.kubernetes.io/created-by=eks-workshop,app.kubernetes.io/instance=ui,app.kubernetes.io/name=ui,pod-template-hash=67d8cf77cf
```

Check the running Pod doesn't have the required Label and Kyverno didn't terminate it, this happened because as seen earlier, Kyverno operates as an `AdmissionController` and will not interfere in resources that already exist in the cluster.

However if you delete the running Pod, it won't be able to be recreated since it doesn't have the required Label. Go ahead and delete de Pod running in the `ui` Namespace.

```bash
$ kubectl -n ui delete pod --all
pod "ui-67d8cf77cf-d4j47" deleted
$ kubectl -n ui get pods
No resources found in ui namespace.
```

As mentioned, the Pod was not recreated, try to force a rollout of the `ui` deployment.

```bash expectError=true
$ kubectl -n ui rollout restart deployment/ui
error: failed to patch: admission webhook "validate.kyverno.svc-fail" denied the request:

resource Deployment/ui/ui was blocked due to the following policies

require-labels:
  autogen-check-team: 'validation error: Label ''CostCenter'' is required to deploy
    the Pod. rule autogen-check-team failed at path /spec/template/metadata/labels/CostCenter/'
```

The rollout failed with the admission webhook denying the request due to the `require-labels` Kyverno Policy.

You can also check this `error` message describing the `ui` deployment, or visualizing the `events` in the `ui` Namespace.

```bash
$ kubectl -n ui describe deployment ui
...
Events:
  Type     Reason             Age                From                   Message
  ----     ------             ----               ----                   -------
  Warning  PolicyViolation    12m (x2 over 9m)   kyverno-scan           policy require-labels/autogen-check-team fail: validation error: Label 'CostCenter' is required to deploy the Pod. rule autogen-check-team failed at path /spec/template/metadata/labels/CostCenter/

$ kubectl -n ui get events | grep PolicyViolation
9m         Warning   PolicyViolation     pod/ui-67d8cf77cf-hvqcd    policy require-labels/check-team fail: validation error: Label 'CostCenter' is required to deploy the Pod. rule check-team failed at path /metadata/labels/CostCenter/
9m         Warning   PolicyViolation     replicaset/ui-67d8cf77cf   policy require-labels/autogen-check-team fail: validation error: Label 'CostCenter' is required to deploy the Pod. rule autogen-check-team failed at path /spec/template/metadata/labels/CostCenter/
9m         Warning   PolicyViolation     deployment/ui              policy require-labels/autogen-check-team fail: validation error: Label 'CostCenter' is required to deploy the Pod. rule autogen-check-team failed at path /spec/template/metadata/labels/CostCenter/
```

Now add the required label `CostCenter` to the `ui` Deployment, using the Kustomization patch below.

```kustomization
modules/security/kyverno/simple-policy/ui-labeled/deployment.yaml
Deployment/ui
```

```bash
$ kubectl apply -k ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/security/kyverno/simple-policy/ui-labeled
namespace/ui unchanged
serviceaccount/ui unchanged
configmap/ui unchanged
service/ui unchanged
deployment.apps/ui configured
$ kubectl -n ui rollout status deployment/ui
$ kubectl -n ui get pods --show-labels
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
ui-5498685db8-k57nk   1/1     Running   0          60s   CostCenter=IT,app.kubernetes.io/component=service,app.kubernetes.io/created-by=eks-workshop,app.kubernetes.io/instance=ui,app.kubernetes.io/name=ui,pod-template-hash=5498685db8
```

As you can see the admission webhook successfully validated the Policy and the Pod was created with the correct Label `CostCenter=IT`!

### Mutating Rules

In the above examples, you checked how Validation Policies work in their default behavior defined in `validationFailureAction`. However Kyverno can also be used to manage Mutating rules within the Policy, in order to modify any API Requests to satisfy or enforce the specified requirements on the Kubernetes resources. The resource mutation occurs before validation, so the validation rules will not contradict the changes performed by the mutation section.

Below is a sample Policy with a mutation rule defined, which will be used to automatically add our label `CostCenter=IT` as default to any `Pod`.

```file
manifests/modules/security/kyverno/simple-policy/add-labels-mutation-policy.yaml
```

Notice the `mutate` section, under the ClusterPolicy `spec`.

Go ahead, and create the above Policy using the following command.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f  ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/security/kyverno/simple-policy/add-labels-mutation-policy.yaml

clusterpolicy.kyverno.io/add-labels created
```

In order to validate the Mutation Webhook, lets this time rollout the `assets` Deployment without explicitly adding a label:

```bash
$ kubectl -n assets rollout restart deployment/assets
deployment.apps/assets restarted
$ kubectl -n assets rollout status deployment/assets
deployment "assets" successfully rolled out
```

Validate the automatically added label `CostCenter=IT` to the Pod to meet the policy requirements, resulting a successful Pod creation even with the Deployment not having the label specified:

```bash
$ kubectl -n assets get pods --show-labels
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
assets-bb88b4789-kmk62   1/1     Running   0          25s   CostCenter=IT,app.kubernetes.io/component=service,app.kubernetes.io/created-by=eks-workshop,app.kubernetes.io/instance=assets,app.kubernetes.io/name=assets,pod-template-hash=bb88b4789
```

It's also possible to mutate existing resources in your Amazon EKS Clusters with Kyverno Policies using `patchStrategicMerge` and `patchesJson6902` parameters in your Kyverno Policy.

This was just a simple example of labels for our Pods with Validating and Mutating rules. This can be applied to various scenarios such as restricting Images from unknown registries, adding Data to Config Maps, Tolerations and much more. In the next upcoming labs, you will go through some more advanced use-cases.
