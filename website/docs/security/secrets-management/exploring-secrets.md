Kubernetes secrets can be exposed to the Pods in different ways such as via environment variables and volumes.

### Exposing Secrets as Environment Variables

You may expose the keys, namely, username and password, in the database-credentials Secret to a Pod as environment variables using a Pod manifest as shown (below):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: someName
  namespace: someNamespace
spec:
  containers:
  - name: someContainer
    image: someImage
    env:
    - name: DATABASE_USER
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: database-credentials
          key: username
    - name: DATABASE_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: database-credentials
          key: password
```

### Exposing Secrets as Volumes

Secrets can also be mounted as data volumes on to a Pod and you can control the paths within the volume where the Secret keys are projected using a Pod manifest as shown (below):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: someName
  namespace: someNamespace
spec:
  containers:
  - name: someContainer
    image: someImage
    volumeMounts:
    - name: secret-volume
      mountPath: "/etc/data"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: database-credentials
      items:
      - key: username
        path: DATABASE_USER 
      - key: password
        path: DATABASE_PASSWORD

```

With the above Pod specification, the following will occur:

* value for the username key in the database-credentials Secret is stored in the file `/etc/data/DATABASE_USER` within the Pod
* value for the password key is stored in the file `/etc/data/DATABASE_PASSWORD`
