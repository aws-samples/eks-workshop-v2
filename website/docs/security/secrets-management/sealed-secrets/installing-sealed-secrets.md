The `kubeseal` CLI is used to interact with the sealed secrets controller, and has already been installed in Cloud9.

The first thing we'll do is install the sealed secrets controller in the EKS cluster:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.18.0/controller.yaml
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --timeout=30s pods -l name=sealed-secrets-controller -n kube-system
```

Now we'll check the status of the pod

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l name=sealed-secrets-controller
sealed-secrets-controller-77747c4b8c-snsxp      1/1     Running   0          5s
```

The logs of the sealed secrets controller show that the controller tries to find any existing private keys during startup. If there are no private keys found, then it creates a new secret with the certificate details.

```bash
$ kubectl logs deployments/sealed-secrets-controller -n kube-system
controller version: 0.18.0
2022/10/18 09:17:01 Starting sealed-secrets controller version: 0.18.0

2022/10/18 09:17:02 New key written to kube-system/sealed-secrets-keyvkl9w
2022/10/18 09:17:02 Certificate is

```

We can view the contents of the Secret which contains the sealing key as a public/private key pair in YAML format as follows:

```bash
$ kubectl get secret -n kube-system -l sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/sealed-secrets-key -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  data:
    tls.crt: LS0tL(...)LQo=
    tls.key: LS0tL(...)LS0K
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: "2022-10-18T09:17:02Z"
    generateName: sealed-secrets-key
    labels:

    name: sealed-secrets-keyvkl9w
