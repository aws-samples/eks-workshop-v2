To demonstrate VPC CNI behavior of adding additional prefixes to our worker nodes, we'll deploy pause pods to utilize more IP addresses than are currently assigned. We're utilizing a large number of these pods to simulate the addition of application pods in to the cluster either through deployments or scaling operations.

```file
manifests/modules/networking/prefix/deployment-pause.yaml
```

This will spin up `150 pods` and may take some time:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -k ~/environment/eks-workshop/modules/networking/prefix
deployment.apps/pause-pods-prefix created
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=60s deployment/pause-pods-prefix -n other
```

Check the pause pods are in a running state:

```bash
$ kubectl get deployment -n other
NAME                READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
pause-pods-prefix   150/150   150          150         101s
```

Once the pods are running successfully, we should be able to see the additional prefixes added to the worker nodes.

```bash
$ aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag-key,Values=eks:cluster-name" "Name=tag-value,Values=${EKS_CLUSTER_NAME}" \
  --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[].{InstanceId: InstanceId, Prefixes: NetworkInterfaces[].Ipv4Prefixes[]}'
```

This demonstrates how the VPC CNI dynamically provisions and attaches `/28` prefixes to the ENI(s) as more pods are scheduled on a given node.
