title: "Reports & Auditing"

Kyverno includes a [Policy Reporting](https://kyverno.io/docs/policy-reports/) tool that uses an open format defined by the Kubernetes Policy Working Group. These reports are deployed as custom resources in the cluster. Kyverno generates these reports when admission actions like _CREATE_, _UPDATE_, and _DELETE_ are performed in the cluster. Reports are also generated as a result of background scans that validate policies on existing resources.

Throughout this workshop, we have created several policies with specific rules. When a resource matches one or more rules according to the policy definition and violates any of them, an entry is created in the report for each violation. This can result in multiple entries if the same resource matches and violates multiple rules. When resources are deleted, their entries are removed from the reports. This means that Kyverno Reports always represent the current state of the cluster and do not record historical information.

As discussed earlier, Kyverno has two types of `validationFailureAction`:

1. `Audit` mode: Allows resources to be created and reports the action in the Policy Reports.
2. `Enforce` mode: Denies resource creation but does not add an entry in the Policy Reports.

For example, if a Policy in `Audit` mode contains a single rule requiring all resources to set the label `CostCenter`, and a Pod is created without that label, Kyverno will allow the Pod's creation but record it as a `FAIL` result in a Policy Report due to the rule violation. If this same Policy is configured with `Enforce` mode, Kyverno will immediately block the resource creation, and this will not generate an entry in the Policy Reports. However, if the Pod is created in compliance with the rule, it will be reported as `PASS` in the report. You can check blocked actions in the Kubernetes events for the Namespace where the action was requested.

Let's examine our cluster's compliance status with the policies we've created so far in this workshop by reviewing the Policy Reports generated.

```bash hook=reports
$ kubectl get policyreports -A

> Note: The output may vary.

As we worked with ClusterPolicies, you can see in the above output that Reports were generated across all Namespaces, not just in the `default` Namespace where we created the resources to be validated. The reports show the status of objects using `PASS`, `FAIL`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `SKIP`.

As mentioned earlier, blocked actions are recorded in the Namespace events. Let's examine those using the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl get events | grep block
8m         Warning   PolicyViolation   clusterpolicy/restrict-image-registries   Pod default/nginx-public: [validate-registries] fail (blocked); validation error: Unknown Image registry. rule validate-registries failed at path /spec/containers/0/image/
3m         Warning   PolicyViolation   clusterpolicy/restrict-image-registries   Pod default/nginx-public: [validate-registries] fail (blocked); validation error: Unknown Image registry. rule validate-registries failed at path /spec/containers/0/image/
```

> Note: The output may vary.

Now, let's take a closer look at the Policy Reports for the `default` Namespace used in the labs:

```bash
$ kubectl get policyreports
NAME                                           PASS   FAIL   WARN   ERROR   SKIP   AGE
default       cpol-baseline-policy             2      0      0      0       0      19m
default       cpol-require-labels              2      0      0      0       0      13m
default       cpol-restrict-image-registries   1      1      0      0       0      13m
```

Notice that for the `restrict-image-registries` ClusterPolicy, we have one `FAIL` and one `PASS` report. This is because all the ClusterPolicies were created with `Enforce` mode, and as mentioned, blocked resources are not reported. Additionally, previously running resources that could violate policy rules were already removed.

The `nginx` Pod, which we left running with a publicly available image, is the only remaining resource that violates the `restrict-image-registries` policy, and it's shown in the report.

To examine the violations for this Policy in more detail, describe the specific report. Use the `kubectl describe` command for the `cpol-restrict-image-registries` Report to see the validation results for the `restrict-image-registries` ClusterPolicy:

```bash
$ kubectl describe policyreport cpol-restrict-image-registries

```

The above output displays the `nginx` Pod policy validation receiving a `fail` Result and validation error Message. On the other hand, the `nginx-ecr` policy validation received a `pass` Result. Monitoring reports in this way could be an overhead for administrators. Kyverno also supports a GUI-based tool for [Policy reporter](https://kyverno.github.io/policy-reporter/core/targets/#policy-reporter-ui), which is outside the scope of this workshop.

In this lab, you learned how to augment the Kubernetes PSA/PSS configurations with Kyverno. Pod Security Standards (PSS) and the in-tree Kubernetes implementation of these standards, Pod Security Admission (PSA), provide good building blocks for managing pod security. The majority of users switching from Kubernetes Pod Security Policies (PSP) should be successful using the PSA/PSS features.

Kyverno enhances the user experience created by PSA/PSS by leveraging the in-tree Kubernetes pod security implementation and providing several helpful enhancements. You can use Kyverno to govern the proper use of pod security labels. Additionally, you can use the new Kyverno `validate.podSecurity` rule to easily manage pod security standards with additional flexibility and an enhanced user experience. And, with the Kyverno CLI, you can automate policy evaluation upstream of your clusters.
